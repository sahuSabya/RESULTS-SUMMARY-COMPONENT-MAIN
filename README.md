## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Laptop-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learnt applying various flexbox properties, CSS postioning, and linear gradients by doing this challenge.
To see, this is how I added code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row nowrap;
  background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, hsl(252, 100%, 67%), hsl(241, 81%, 54%));
}
```

### Continued development

Areas that I want to continue focussing on in future projects:
- CSS Positioning
- CSS Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [WEBDEV CSS Docs 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - This helped me for various CSS properties.
- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
